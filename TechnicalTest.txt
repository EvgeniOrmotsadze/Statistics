Technical test instructions
===========================

1. Fix compilation.
-------------------
We have detected that the project is not compiling anymore.
    * Check what is broken, fix it and continue development.

To run this application, you need to execute main method from Application class.

2. Calculate statistics and write the output.
---------------------------------------------
We need to calculate the statistics about the data inside the file data.example. These statistics will
be stored in XML and JSON formats.

The statistics that you have to calculate are:
    * Total Number Of Words
    * Total Number Of Unique Words
    * Average Characters Per Word
    * Most Repeated Word

You can calculate all this data in class StatisticsCalculator.

Use the classes that implements StatisticsWriter to store this data in XML and JSON formats.
There is a XSD file with the XML scheme (statistics.xsd) to help you with the XML conversion,
you can use it to make a Statistic bean to store all the statistics. 
It would be good if you can complete the unit tests at StatisticsTest.

3. Transform data.
------------------
We need that you develop the following tasks inside TransformersData class of transformers module:
    * Convert everything to uppercase.
    * Remove all repeated entries.
    * Sort it by length: first, words of one letter, second: words of two letters, etc.

Be sure everything works as expected by adding some unit tests in TransformersDataTest.
